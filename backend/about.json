    "bio": "I am an innovative, people-driven full stack software engineer with a passion for executing solutions that prioritize users. With my psychology degree, I take pride in creating products that are intuitive, user friendly, and clean in their design. In my previous career in customer experience in the hospitality industry, I refined my expertise in providing efficient and memorable customer service. I am naturally very creative, a fast learner, and I care about the quality of job that I do-whether I am building a website, debugging an app, or serving you your favorite meal, I will always strive to provide the best experience imaginable. Growing up in a large family of 15 children, I've become a master in working with others in problem solving, finding solutions, and effectively communicating those solutions."
